# How To Seed data into firebase


<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites"> 
This guide walks you through the process of seeding data that is provided by our team into your Firebase Firestore using a Node.js script. Prerequisites for this guide is that you have already setup a firebase console project and that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before you start.
 </Admonition> 

## Set Up a New Directory 
Create a directory for your script by navigating to where you want to create this project and run commands: 
```bash 
mkdir firestore-import 
cd firestore-import
```

## Initialize a Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```
This creates a package.json file.

## Get Your Service Account from firebase

Head to the firebase console and download it

Rename this downloaded file to `serviceAccountKey.json` and put it in the root of the project we created above (`firestore-import`). 

## Import seed folder and Install dependency 

Next go ahead and import our seed folder. (usually name `dataSeed` having json files inside it). Next we will go ahead and add the npm package we need to seed our firebase.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```bash
npm install firestore-export-import
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
yarn add firestore-export-import
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add final code that does the magic

Your almost there! finally create a file `importData.js` inside the root project and put the below code inside it.

```js
const { initializeFirebaseApp, restore } = require('firestore-export-import');
const serviceAccount = require('./serviceAccountKey.json');
const path = require('path');

// Replace with your Firestore database URL
const databaseURL = 'https://your-database-name.firebaseio.com';

// Path to your JSON file
const jsonFilePath = path.resolve(__dirname, './dataSeed/vendors.json');

// Initialize Firebase
const firestore = initializeFirebaseApp(serviceAccount);

// Import data
restore(firestore, jsonFilePath)
  .then((status) => {
    console.log('Data imported successfully:', status);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error importing data:', error);
  });
```

At this point you should have a project looking like:

## Final Command

Great, your done setting up the project! Final commands left to run would be:

```bash
node importData.js
```
You should see message <span style={{color: 'green'}}> Data imported successfully: \{ status: true, message: 'Collection successfully imported!\} </span> in terminal.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Pro Tip">

Go ahead and change the code line inside your `importData.js` file and change the json file name to the other files we have included inside the dataSeed folder: 

```js
const jsonFilePath = path.resolve(__dirname, './dataSeed/vendor_product.json'); // now to seed the other collection
```
and run command <code>node importData.js </code> for each file inside the `dataSeed` folder we have included.

Great Job! You have sucessfully seeded your firebase with our seed data. Go ahead to your firestore to see the imported datas. You should find new data inserted:
