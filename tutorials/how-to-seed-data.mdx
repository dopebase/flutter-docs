# How To Seed data into firebase


<Admonition type="note" title="Prerequisites"> 
This guide walks you through the process of seeding data that is provided by our team into your Firebase Firestore using a Node.js script. Prerequisites for this guide is that you have already setup a firebase console project and that you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine before you start.
:::tip
 If you find a folder named `seed` inside your ***firebase_folder/functions*** you can go to [this section](#seeding-your-firebase-using-a-firebase-function) to learn how to seed the data.
:::
 </Admonition> 

## Set Up a New Directory 
Create a directory for your script by navigating to where you want to create this project and run commands: 
```bash 
mkdir firestore-import 
cd firestore-import
```

## Initialize a Node.js project:

```bash
npm init -y
```
This creates a package.json file.

## Get Your Service Account from firebase

Head to the firebase console and download it 

![](../../static/img/annotely_image_8.jpeg)

Rename this downloaded file to `serviceAccountKey.json` and put it in the root of the project we created above (`firestore-import`). 

## Import seed folder and Install dependency 

Next go ahead and import our seed folder. (usually name `dataSeed` having json files inside it). Next we will go ahead and add the npm package we need to seed our firebase.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>
    ```bash
npm install firestore-export-import
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">
    ```bash
yarn add firestore-export-import
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Add final code that does the magic

Your almost there! finally create a file `importData.js` inside the root project and put the below code inside it.

```js
const { initializeFirebaseApp, restore } = require('firestore-export-import');
const serviceAccount = require('./serviceAccountKey.json');
const path = require('path');

// Path to your JSON file
const jsonFilePath = path.resolve(__dirname, './dataSeed/vendors.json');

// Initialize Firebase
const firestore = initializeFirebaseApp(serviceAccount);

// Import data
restore(firestore, jsonFilePath)
  .then((status) => {
    console.log('Data imported successfully:', status);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error importing data:', error);
  });
```

At this point you should have a project looking like:
![](../../static/img/Screen-Shot-2024-12-02-at-10.03.31-AM.png)

## Final Command

Great, your done setting up the project! Final commands left to run would be:

```bash
node importData.js
```
You should see message <span style={{color: 'green'}}> Data imported successfully: \{ status: true, message: 'Collection successfully imported!\} </span> in terminal.

<Admonition type="tip" title="Pro Tip">

Go ahead and change the code line inside your `importData.js` file and change the json file name to the other files we have included inside the dataSeed folder: 

```js
const jsonFilePath = path.resolve(__dirname, './dataSeed/vendor_product.json'); // now to seed the other collection
```
and run command <code>node importData.js </code> for each file inside the `dataSeed` folder we have included.
</Admonition>


Great Job! You have sucessfully seeded your firebase with our seed data. Go ahead to your firestore to see the imported datas. You should find new data inserted:

***Congratulations! You have successfully set up your project and seeded your Firebase Firestore with data provided by our team.***


## Seeding your Firebase using a Firebase Function

If you navigate to your `firebase_directory/functions/seed/dbSeed.js` folder, you'll find a seed function that can be deployed to Firebase. Inside your `dbSeed.js` of the firebase, head to the bottom of the file and change the line to your project name as well:

```js
const deleteCollection = async collectionPath => {
  await tools.firestore.delete(collectionPath, {
    project: 'fir-project-e56c1', // your firebase project Id here
    recursive: true,
    yes: true,
    force: true,
  })
}
```
Next, after deploying your Firebase functions following our deployment guide <a href="./how-to-deploy-your-firebase-functions">here</a>:. If you head to the Functions inside your firebase console, you'll see the function URL in your Firebase Console. 


![](../../static/img/annotely_image_9.png)


To use this seeding function, you'll need an authentication token. Here's how to obtain it:

1. First, locate the file `authClient.js` in your project: `<your_instamobile_product>`/src/core/onboarding/api/firebase/authClient.js


2. Modify the `loginWithEmailAndPassword` method by adding the token logging line:

```js
export const loginWithEmailAndPassword = async (email, password) => {
return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
 auth()
   .signInWithEmailAndPassword(email, password)
   .then(async response => {
     const uid = response.user.uid

     const tokenn = await response.user.getIdToken();
     console.log("Your Auth Token is: ", tokenn) // Add this line to get your token
     const userData = {
       email,
       id: uid,
     }
     usersRef
       .doc(uid)
       .get()
       .then(function (firestoreDocument) {
         if (!firestoreDocument.exists) {
           // User does not exist anymore in users collection, but it exists in Auth, so we create a new one
           usersRef.doc(uid).set(userData, { merge: true })
           resolve({
             user: { ...userData },
             warning:
               "Your account has been previously removed automatically, so now it's incomplete.",
             errorCode: ErrorCode.noUser,
           })
           return
         }
         const user = firestoreDocument.data()
         const newUserData = {
           ...userData,
           ...user,
         }
         resolve({ user: newUserData })
       })
       .catch(function (_error) {
         console.log('_error:', _error)
         resolve({ error: ErrorCode.serverError })
       })
   })
   .catch(error => {
     console.log('error:', error)
     var errorCode = ErrorCode.serverError
     switch (error.code) {
       case 'auth/wrong-password':
         errorCode = ErrorCode.invalidPassword
         break
       case 'auth/network-request-failed':
         errorCode = ErrorCode.serverError
         break
       case 'auth/user-not-found':
         errorCode = ErrorCode.noUser
         break
       default:
         errorCode = ErrorCode.serverError
     }
     resolve({ error: errorCode })
   })
})
}
```

After logging in as a user, you should see your authentication token in the console: <span style={{color: 'green'}}>Your Auth Token is: [your-token]</span>

### Making the Seed Request

With your authentication token and function URL, you can now make the seeding request using any API client like (Postman, Insomnia, or VS Code's Thunder Client):

- Set the request method to POST
- Use your Firebase Function URL - You copied above
- Add the following JSON in the request body:
```json
{
  "data": {}
}
```
- Add Authorization Header (your token that was logged in the console above)

Here's how your request should look:


<div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '20px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    ![](@site/static/img/page_1.png)
  </div>
  <div style={{ flex: 1 }}>
    ![](@site/static/img/page_2.png)
  </div>
</div>

Great! now you should see your users populated in your firestore database.
